        <p style="font-size: 20px">The <strong>FX-05 Xiuhcoatl</strong> is a Mexican rifle, designed and built by the <em>Dirección General de Industria Militar del Ejército</em> through the Fábricas Militares. The rifle was officially presented in the military parade on September 16, 2006, in the hands of the Special Forces Airmobile Group, GAFE.</p>
        <h2 style="color: forestgreen;">Development</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 20px">The development of the FX-05 began as a 16-month research in 2005 with <em>CIADTIM</em> as part of research effort to replace the HK G3A3 rifles that were in service with the Mexican military. Originally the HK G36 was supposed to become the Mexican military's standard rifle as plans were already drawn to transfer technology and equipment to Mexico to initially build 30,000 rifles at a cost of $63,016,125 as part of Mexico's military modernization program. The mexican goverment ultimately decided that they wanted a more cost effective alternative to the G36, which resulted in the decision to end the project before any technology or equipment could be transferred and the FX-05 project was undertaken.</p>
        <h2 style="color: forestgreen;">Design details</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 20px">Most details about the FX-05 are classified as <strong>Top Secret</strong>, as this is supposed to be a distinctive indigenously-produced weapon for use by Mexico's elite forces. This is to prevent anti-government and criminal organizations from mocking-up copies to aid in infiltrating secure areas, impersonating military personnel, or appearing to have legitimate support for their cause and its actions. It also helps to prevent hostile or enemy forces from learning the abilities, strengths, weaknesses, and limitations of the new weapon series.</p>
